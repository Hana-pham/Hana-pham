# Xin chao 👋, My name is Hana

I’m a tech enthusiast focused on building smart, efficient, and creative solutions through **AI, automation, and testing**. I love turning repetitive tasks into smooth workflows, and exploring how intelligent systems can make software more reliable and life a little easier.

## 💻 What I Do

I'm currently exploring and building in these areas:
- 🤖 **AI-powered test automation** – smarter, faster QA
- ⚙️ **Python automation** – scripts, bots, and tools that save time
- 🧪 **Testing frameworks** – Selenium, Playwright, Pytest
- 🌐 **Real-world applications** – websites, dashboards, data tools

I believe great tech is built with curiosity, consistency, and care. I enjoy creating things that are both useful and elegant—whether it's a test suite or a recipe site.

## 🔨 Projects in Progress
- 🔍 **Website QA Automation** – full test suite with browser automation and reports
- 🧠 **AI Test Case Generator** – using LLMs to create intelligent test plans
- 🛠️ **Workflow Automation Scripts** – Python tools that automate real business processes
- 📊 **Dashboard for Test Results** – data visualized clearly using Streamlit
- 🍰 **Creative Side Projects** – recipe website, flower gallery, and more to come

## 🧠 Mindset & Motivation

Tech isn’t just about code—it’s about solving problems, sharing ideas, and always learning. I approach every project with a builder’s mindset:  
**"How can I make this better, simpler, or smarter?"**
